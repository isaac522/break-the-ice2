    <h2>Equilibrium</h2>
  

    <h2>Why Are Glaciers Melting?</h2>
    <p>
        Glaciers are melting primarily due to rising global temperatures caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These activities release greenhouse gases   
 like carbon dioxide and methane,   
 which trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere. This trapped heat causes glaciers to melt at an accelerated rate.

    <h2>What We Can Do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and switch to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.</li>
        <li>Improve energy efficiency in homes and buildings to reduce energy consumption.</li>
        <li>Support sustainable forestry practices to reduce deforestation and increase carbon capture.</li>
        <li>Adopt more sustainable transportation options like cycling, walking, and public transport.</li>
        <li>Advocate for policies that support climate action and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
    </ul>
